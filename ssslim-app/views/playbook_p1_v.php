    <p>The journey to becoming a full-fledged cognitive enterprise begins with defining your
        priorities. Where do you need to evolve? Where do you want to win with your consumer?
        To get you started, we’ve teed up a relevant case study outlining a company’s reinvention of

        CASE STUDY: City Furniture
    </h2>
    <h3 class="black">
        In moving SKUs and customer data to the cloud, City Furniture gave store
        associates deep knowledge of inventory and customers that they can use
        while on the floor.
    </h3>
    
    <h3>Challenge:</h3>
    
    <p>
        Given the limitations of showroom associates helping customers with antiquated “green
        screen” technology at fixed workstations, City Furniture wanted to make shopping and
        buying as informative, easy and engaging as it is online.

            <h3>Solution</h3>
            <p>
                IBM iX’s mobile and customer and engagement design teams worked with Apple to create three MobileFirst for iOS apps: Sales Assist, Payment, and Finance.<br />
                Designed to work together on iPad Pro tablets, the apps let associates access real-time data, process payments and schedule deliveries, all without leaving the
                customer’s side or disrupting the sales process.
